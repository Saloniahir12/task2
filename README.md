📘 Student Record Management System
This is a simple Java console-based Student Record Management System that allows users to add, view, update, and delete student records. It's designed using basic Java concepts such as:

Classes and Objects

ArrayList (for dynamic student storage)

Scanner class (for user input)

Loops and Conditional Statements

Single Class File (clean and modular structure)

🔧 Features:
✅ Add a new student with ID, Name, and Marks

📋 View all student records

✏️ Update an existing student's details using their ID

❌ Delete a student record by ID

🚪 Exit the program safely

🛠 Technologies Used:
Language: Java

IDE: You can use any Java IDE like IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code

No external libraries required

💡 How it works:
The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

User selects an option from the menu (1 to 5).

Based on the option, corresponding actions are performed on an ArrayList of students.

Each student is stored as an object of the Student inner  class, containing id, name, and marks.
